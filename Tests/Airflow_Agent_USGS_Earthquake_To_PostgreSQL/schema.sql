-- Database setup for USGS Earthquake Data Pipeline
-- The agent should analyze the API response and create appropriate table(s) and schema

-- Basic database setup - agent needs to create the earthquake data table(s)
-- The agent should:
-- 1. Explore the USGS API response structure
-- 2. Design appropriate table schema(s) based on the GeoJSON data
-- 3. Choose suitable data types and constraints
-- 4. Add relevant indexes for performance

-- No tables are pre-created - the agent must design and create them based on API exploration
