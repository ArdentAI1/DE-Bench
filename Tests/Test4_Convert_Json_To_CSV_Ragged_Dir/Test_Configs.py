There is a folder called `data` in this current directory, `Exercises/Exercise-4`. There are also
`json` files located at various spots inside this directory structure.

Your task is two use `Python` to find all the `json` files located in the `data` folder.
Once you find them all, read them with `Python` and convert them to `csv` files, to do this
you will have to flatten out some of the nested `json` data structures.

For example there is a `{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-99.9,16.88333]}` that must flattened.

Generally, your script should do the following ...
1. Crawl the `data` directory with `Python` and identify all the `json` files.
2. Load all the `json` files.
3. Flatten out the `json` data structure.
4. Write the results to a `csv` file, one for one with the json file, including the header names.
